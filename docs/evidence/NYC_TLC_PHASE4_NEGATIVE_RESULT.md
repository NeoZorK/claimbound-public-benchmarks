## Failed Gates

The candidate did not pass every required control. In particular, the shuffled
control comparison did not meet the frozen positive-rate gate.

This was recorded as a failure, not as a near miss.

## Allowed Claim

```text
NYC TLC Phase 4 official-source proof-of-work completed; source audit passed
and statistical acceptance failed under the pre-registered protocol.
```

## Forbidden Claims

Do not claim:

- NYC evidence passed;
- universal forecasting edge;
- transport deployment readiness;
- public-health or energy claims from NYC evidence;
- near miss equals success.
